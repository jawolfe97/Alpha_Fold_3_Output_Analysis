The Python code generates a ChimeraX .cxc file for generating intra and inter-ensemble distances between a known crystal structure based on a combined PDB file from multiple unique AlphaFold3 refolding simulations. Another set of Python code extracts data from these output files and plots the analysis results.

The code is more of a demonstration of how I accomplished this analysis and should be tailored to your system of interest. To best use this resource, I recommend downloading the whole folder and running each Python file through the IDLE and editing lines as needed to account for your system of interest.
